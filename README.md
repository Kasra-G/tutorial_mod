# Tutorial Mod 1.16
This is my first Minecraft mod.
It is mostly a mod to familiarize myself with writing mods.
## Features:
- Silver ore generation
- Silver tools
  - These tools are about the same speed as diamond 
    but are a tier lower. It's shiny, so it enchants well.
- Silver armor
- More features soon
## Pictures:
Soon.
## Dependencies:
- Forge 1.16
## Compatibilities:
- JEI (tested)
- Untested with other mods that add silver. May cause conflicts.
## Installation:
1. Download the latest release `.jar`
2. Put the `.jar` into the `mods` folder in your forge installation directory
