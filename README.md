# Tutorial Mod 1.16

It is mostly a mod to familiarize myself with writing mods.

  - Mine silver ore deep underground to make tools, weapons, and armor.
- Silver tools
  - About the same speed as diamond with less durability

- Silver weapons
  - Fast attack speed
  - Base damage is lower than diamond, but deals much more damage to undead mobs.
  - Very high enchantability
- Silver armor
  - Wear a full set to trick nearby silverfish into thinking you
    are an alpha silverfish. They will keep
    close to you and fight mobs that you attack or that attack you.
    - If you stop having a full set of silver armor they will realize you are
      not one of them and turn on you.
  - Similar to Iron Armor in terms of protection
  - Very high enchantability
