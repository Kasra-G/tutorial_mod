# Tutorial Mod 1.16
This is my first Minecraft mod.
It is mostly a mod to familiarize myself with writing mods.
## Features:
- Silver ore generation
- Silver tools
  - These tools are about the same speed as diamond 
    but are a tier lower. It's shiny, so it enchants well.
- Silver armor
  - Wear a full set to trick nearby silverfish into thinking you
    are an alpha silverfish. They will keep
  close to you and fight mobs that you attack or that attack you.
    If you stop having a full set of silver armor they will realize you are
    not one of them and turn on you.
  - Nearby silverfish will gain speed, strength, and health when wearing a full set.
- More features soon
